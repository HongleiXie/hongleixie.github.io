<span class="dropcap">L</span>ast Saturday night I watched a documentary film, *linsanity*, about [Jeremy Lin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Lin), the model Asian Ameriacian NBA player.

Since there are too many articles analyzing *linsanity* phenomenon and I don't think I'm the right person to talk much about something like asian american struggles in WASP-dominated society, and why people from all over the world are so crazy about him, or  how to make it in NBA .... Most of answers actually can be found in the movie. 

What I'm gonna talk is DREAM and DREAM BIG. From my perspective, I only saw a little boy who were dying for playing basketball and he finally proved to people he can play NBA through his own way. In spite of his asian american identity, he just realized the so-called American Dream.  

Particularly I was deeply moved by his faith to God and how his mother always unconditionally supported him to play the game which is not usual for an Asian parent.

When he talked about how did he go through tough times, he said: 
***"God loves me, and that he has the perfect plan for me. His plan will take me through a lots of ups and downs, but if I stay faithful to him that in the end he will work everything for my good. Now when I play basketball, I don’t play for anyone else, I only play for God. That’s the type of purpose that he gave me, and once he gave me that purpose, is when I found my peace, and once I got my peace, that’s when I got my joy.”***

Never doubt it at all. I found it related to my life, my dream and my story. Just as the same as Jeremy's, I'm in my long journey to what I want to accomplish. If you still have something to be believed,  I strongly suggest you to watch this [movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLUAOe-B-yo).
