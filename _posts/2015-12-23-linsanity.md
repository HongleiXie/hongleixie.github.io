<span class="dropcap">L</span>ast Saturday night I watched a documentary film called *linsanity* starred [Jeremy Lin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Lin) who is the model Asian American NBA player.

There are too many articles analyzing *linsanity* phenomenon and I don't think I'm the right person to talk much about something like Asian American struggles in WASP-dominated society. What I'm gonna talk instead is the _DREAM_ and _DREAM BIG_. From my perspective I only saw a little boy who was dying for playing basketball and he finally proved to people he can play NBA through his own way. Coupled with his Asian American identity, he just realized the so-called American Dream.

Particularly I was deeply moved by his faith to God and how his mother always unconditionally supported him to play the game which is not usual for an Asian parent.

When he talked about how did he go through tough times, he said:
***"God loves me, and that he has the perfect plan for me. His plan will take me through a lots of ups and downs, but if I stay faithful to him that in the end he will work everything for my good. Now when I play basketball, I don’t play for anyone else, I only play for God. That’s the type of purpose that he gave me, and once he gave me that purpose, is when I found my peace, and once I got my peace, that’s when I got my joy.”***

Never doubt it at all. If you still have something to believe in, I strongly suggest you to watch this [movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLUAOe-B-yo).
