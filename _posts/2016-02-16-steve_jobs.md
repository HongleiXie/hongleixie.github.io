<span class="dropcap">I</span>t has been a long time since last update. A lot of changes happen to me and that's why I need some time planning and organizing stuff. I'm launching a new career chapter for myslef, hopefully working on influential yet cool projects at a big organization. I just happen to be remined the Steve Job's quotes and I feel I must write down what I'm feeling.

***“You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the 
heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. 
So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle ... "***


Yups, I think I have found it and I know it! Discovering the real passion for either life or work is hard, but I know it when I spent the whole weekend, even staying late, just to write a small piece of python code to address an interesting statistics probelm.
