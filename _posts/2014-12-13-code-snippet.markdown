Y</span>ou'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes! To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
{% endhighlight %}

----------
Just to test the R code as follows:

```r
> library(pryr)
> x <- 1:10
> c(address(x), refs(x))
> [1] "0x103100060" "1"
```
