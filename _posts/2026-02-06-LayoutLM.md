title:  "LayoutLM vs. LLMs + OCR: When Specialized Models Still Win"

<span class="dropcap">O</span>ver the last a couple of years, I’ve seen more and more document pipelines quietly converge on the same pattern: OCR a PDF, dump everything into a large language model, and hope the model figures out the rest.
And to be fair — sometimes it works remarkably well.
But every time I see LayoutLM described as “obsolete” or “unnecessary now that we have multimodal LLMs,” it feels like something important is getting lost in the conversation. Not because LayoutLM is newer or more powerful — it isn’t — but because it encodes a very different idea of what document understanding actually is.

This post isn’t about arguing that LayoutLM is better than LLMs. It’s about explaining why, in many real-world document workflows, specialized models with strong inductive bias still win — quietly, reliably, and for very boring reasons.

## Two Ways of Thinking About Documents
At a high level, today’s document pipelines tend to fall into two camps.

### 1. The “LLMs + OCR” Approach
- OCR extracts text (sometimes with bounding boxes)
- The document is serialized into a sequence
- A large language model is prompted to reason over it
The implicit assumption here is simple: if the text is present, the model can recover the structure.

### 2. The LayoutLM Approach
LayoutLM and its successors take a different stance: 
- text, layout, and (later) visual signals are modeled jointly 
- spatial relationships are first-class inputs
- structure is not inferred — it’s expected

## Comparison
What I observed is that general-purpose LLMs excel at ad-hoc document Q&A, summarization across heterogeneous formats, low-volume, high-variance inputs, rapid prototyping with little or no labeled data. Particularly When the task is fuzzy and human-like reasoning dominates, LLMs are incredibly effective.
But structured extraction is a different problem.
And we cannot ignore the hidden cost of "LLMs + OCR" approach. In an addition to the usual pitfalls associated with LLMs such as sensitive to prompts, reproducibility is hard to guaranteed etc, more importantly, once a document is flattenen, reading order becomes heuristic, tables collapse into ambiguous sequences and spatial cues are weakened or lost. Maybe multimodal LLMs come to rescue? 

## The Real Answer: Hybrid Systems

The best systems I’ve seen don’t choose sides. They use LayoutLM-style models for structured extraction, use LLMs for reasoning, summarization, and exception handling, route low-confidence cases intelligently and most importantly, keep humans in the loop where it matters.
The more I work with documents, the more convinced I am that document understanding is not just "language understanding with PDFs". Documents are spatial artifacts. They encode meaning through proximity, alignment, repetition, and convention. When we flatten them into text, we discard information — and ask language models to reconstruct it from scratch. LayoutLM works well not because it’s larger or newer, but because it’s biased in the right way. It assumes structure exists and pays attention to it from the very first layer.
