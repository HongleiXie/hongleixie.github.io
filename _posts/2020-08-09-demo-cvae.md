<span class="dropcap">R</span> ecently I integrated a TensorFlow-enabled ML model into the [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) web app in less
than 40 lines of [codes](https://github.com/HongleiXie/demo-CVAE/blob/master/app.py). Then I deploy the app on [Heroku](www.heroku.com),
a low-code platform for deploying, managing and scaling modern apps. In this post, I will show briefly how to do it. Streamlit is the easiest app framework that I have ever seen, best suited for data scientists and machine learning engineers. If you haven't heard
about it, I strongly recommend you to give a try. Streamlit, togehter with Heroku, help people like me who don't have extensive DevOps experience, quickly share and productionize experimentation results.

## Pre-train your model
First of all, you need to train your [ML model](https://github.com/HongleiXie/demo-CVAE/blob/master/train.py) and save it. Here I created a conditional variational autoencoder model in TensorFlow to generate synthetic MNIST style handwriting digits.

## Create the Streamlit app
To create a web app using Streamlit is super easy. Here is the example where I created a simple [app](https://github.com/HongleiXie/demo-CVAE/blob/master/app.py), allowing the users to pick a digit from 0 to 9 and the number of generated images to be shown.

Up to this point, you should be able to launch the app locally by running:

```bash
$ streamlit run app.py
```

It's highly recommended that you make your application name as `app.py`.

## Host the app on Heroku
Now it's time to deploy the app so the public can access it. Let's break down the process into a few steps as below.
- Sign up on [Heroku](www.heroku.com)
- Make a file named `Procfile` and paste these:
```bash
web: sh setup.sh && streamlit run app.py
```
- Make a file named `setup.sh` and paste these:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.streamlit/
echo "\
[server]\n\
headless = true\n\
enableCORS=false\n\
port = $PORT\n\
" > ~/.streamlit/config.toml
```

- Make a file named `requirements.txt` where you put all the required python modules there.
- Git push the changes you just made.
- Download and install [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install) .
- Now return to your terminal, type `heroku login`, which will open a browser for you to log in.
- Once you log in, you can create an app by `heroku create <your-app-name>`
- Almost there! One last thing is to push all files into heroku master repo by running commands:

```bash
git push heroku master
```

Patiently wait for a while to install all dependencies and package all of the artifacts. :boom:! You should be able to access the web by `https://<your-app-name>.herokuapp.com`!
