<span class="dropcap">I</span> have been in love with writing since childhood. I found out writing is a powerful way to keep track of my work and life, refresh thoughts, even relax emotionally. I will become aware of the reality of the situation when I step back and take a look at my articles. Inspired by <a href = "http://yihui.name/en">Yihui Xie</a> who is a well-known data scientist in the Chinese R/stats community, I finally decided to do it today!

### How do I create this website

The website is created with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a simple, blog-aware, static site generator, and hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. The reason why I use them is because I can have full control over everything: posts, layouts, figures, syntax highlighting of codes, even LaTex-like mathematical formulas! Literally everything. Check out <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">this article</a> for the story behind Jekyll. The articles are written with <a href="https://stackedit.io/">StackEdit</a> so that I only need to focus on writing. The theme is originally from [here](http://brianmaierjr.com/long-haul/).


### What you will find here

- My previous and underway side-projects in the area of machine learning, big data, statistical modeling, deep learning ...
- 除了技术类的东西，我也会装模作样尽点所谓当代“知识分子”的责任，写点酸腐的文字，努力向我的偶像[王小波](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%8E%8B%E5%B0%8F%E6%B3%A2)和[刘瑜](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%88%98%E7%91%9C_(%E5%BD%93%E4%BB%A3%E4%BD%9C%E5%AE%B6))靠近。
