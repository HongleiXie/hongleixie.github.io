<span class="dropcap">I</span> have been in love with writing since childhood. I found out writing is a powerful way to keep track of my work and life, refresh thoughts, even relax emotionally. I will become aware of the reality of the situation when I step back and take a look at my articles. Inspired by <a href = "http://yihui.name/en">Yihui Xie</a> who is a well-known data scientist in the Chinese R/stats community, I finally decided to do it today!

### How do I create this website

The website is created with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a simple, blog-aware, static site generator, and hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. The reason why I use them is because I can have full control over everything: posts, layouts, figures, syntax highlighting of codes, even LaTex-like mathematical formulas! Literally everything. Check out <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">this article</a> for the story behind Jekyll. The articles are written with <a href="https://stackedit.io/">StackEdit</a> so that I only need to focus on writing instead of annoying format stuff. The theme is originally from [here](http://brianmaierjr.com/long-haul/).
However, I did have some trouble in adding new things together. I need to get familiar with basic HTML and CSS knowledge quickly to customize. Then I was thinking about using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to insert math formulas in Jekyll. In Chinese, we normally call it as 折腾. Well, I admit it's a bit time-conusing at the very beginning, after that you will just find it worth the time! 

### What you will find here

- I will post my previous and underway projects in this website, mostly during my studies in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the <a href = "https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/">
University of Waterloo</a>.
- What I have learned in statistical computing,machine learning, big data, statistical modelling, mathematical finance, etc.  (Yup, I do have a wide range of interests.)
- In an addition to technical stuff, I will also post photos that I took, books that I read, my favourite Chinese poems, thoughts about life ... just to tell you that I'm a real human being not a robot :) Most posts falling into this category will be written in Chinese though.
