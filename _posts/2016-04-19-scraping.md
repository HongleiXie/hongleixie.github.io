<span class="dropcap">W</span>eb crawling is much easier than it sounds like. At least it's true from my experiences. I just come to the Python world for about 3 weeks and now, with the help of a few modules, I'm able to scrape IMDB (static) pages. So ... it's not that hard. Why static pages? You will find it much more difficult if the web page you are scraping is dynamic, which means contents of interest are return values from some `js` function.  Of course there are some ways to do it, but needing extra efforts and time.  Standing on a beginner point, I will skip that part for now. 

### Step by Step
Simply speaking, there are 3 steps to scrape a webpage:

 1. Request to visit that particular webpage, just like what your browser does, and download the HTML contents into your environment. I used `requests` module to accomplish this. `urllib2`, `urllib3` are also available choices.
 2.  `BeautifulSoup` module can be used to parse HTML contents.  In addition to that, it provides very powerful and useful functions, searching through the `soup` object to match for text and HTML tags within the page.
 3. Extract what you want from the webpage and download/store them for further analysis.

Here I'm going to present the example of scraping IMDB top 250 movies and want to visualize the count distribution over time.

First of all, let's import some modules and set up the working directory. Besides, I also want to check the current encoding system because, as you may imagine, there are a few top 250 movie names are not English.

import urllib2
import os
import requests
import re
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import sys
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


os.getcwd() # current working directory
os.chdir('/Users/Honglei/Desktop')   # change current working directory

# get the current encoding
type = sys.getfilesystemencoding()
```
I downloaded the HTML texts as `page` and created the `soup` object. Just open the URL link below and view the page source (Windows try <kbd>Ctrl+U</kbd>) You may run  `print soup.prettify()` to see the nicer formatted HTML.

```python
# request the webpage
req = requests.get("http://www.imdb.com/chart/top?pf_rd_m=A2FGELUUNOQJNL&pf_rd_p=2417962742&pf_rd_r=0M85G1V8JHW928EHBETF&pf_rd_s=right-4&pf_rd_t=15506&pf_rd_i=moviemeter&ref_=chtmvm_ql_3")
page = req.text

soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser')
#print soup.prettify()
```
After a little bit analysis on the string pattern, I found out that all movie information are under `<td class="titleColumn">` and the  it follows the patter:
`<a href="url_link" title = "People_Names" Movie_Names </a><span class="secondaryInfo">(Year)</span>`
What I want to extract are the **[Movie_Names]** and **[Year]**.

```python
# get top 250 movie names and years
movie_names = []
movie_year = [0] * 250

j = 0
for i in range(250):
    content = str(soup.findAll('td', {'class':'titleColumn'})[i])
    content = content.decode("UTF-8").encode(type)
    name = re.findall ( '>(.*?)</a>', content)
    movie_names.insert(len(movie_names), name)
    
    year = str(soup.findAll('span', {'class':'secondaryInfo'})[i])
    movie_year[i] = int(re.findall(r"\(([0-9_]+)\)", year)[0])
    
    print('We now have ' + str(j) + ' movies') 
    j = j+1



print movie_names
print movie_year
``` 

Export the movie names into txt file and plot.

```python
# export to the text file
open("top250names.txt", "w").write("\n".join(("\t".join(item)) for item in movie_names))

######## plot the count by time #########################

# compute the frequency table
y = np.bincount(movie_year)
ii = np.nonzero(y)[0]
out = zip(ii, y[ii])
# crete a dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(out, columns = ['Year', 'Freq'], index = ii)
# drop the first Year column since I already assign valid index
df.drop(df.columns[0], axis = 1)
# plot
plt.plot(ii, df['Freq']);
```

### Conclusion
It's obvious we don't get evenly quality movies every year.
