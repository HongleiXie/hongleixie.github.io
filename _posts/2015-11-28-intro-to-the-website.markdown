<span class="dropcap">I</span> have been in love with writing since childhood because I found out keeping track of work and life is very helpful with not wasting my time.  Inspired by <a href = "http://yihui.name/en">Yihui Xie</a> who is a well-known data scientist in the Chinese R/stats community, and my friend <a href = "http://linxihui.github.io/">Eric</a>, I finally decided to do it today!

###How do I create the website
The website is created with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a simple, blog-aware, static site generator, and <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> where I can manage codes easily. The reason why I use them is that you can have full control over everything: your posts, layouts, figures, syntax highlighting of codes, even LaTex-like mathematical formulas! Literally everything. Check out the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll Docs</a> for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. The articles are written with <a href="https://stackedit.io/">StackEdit</a> so that I only need to focus on writing instead of annoying format stuff. 
However, I did have some trouble in mixing different kinds of things. First of all, I need to get familiar with basic HTML and CSS knowledge quickly. Secondly, I was thinking about using Mathjax to incorporate math formulas in Jekyll. That's why I'm using [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/index.html) now. In Chinese, we normally call it as 折腾. Well, I admit it's a bit of time-conusing at the very beginning, after that you will just find it worth the time! 

###What you will find in my website
- I will post my previous/ongoing projects in this website, mostly during my studies in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the <a href = "https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/">
University of Waterloo</a> and some internships.
- What I have learned in statistical computing, interesting mathematical theory, machine learning, bid data, statistical modelling, mathematical finance, etc.  (Yup, I do have a wide range of interests.)
- In an addition to technical stuff, I will also post photos that I took, my favourite Chinese poems, thoughts about life, jokes, introducing a bunch of guys who have great influence on me. Just to tell you that I'm a real HUMAN BEING not a robot :) Most posts falling into this category will be written in Chinese.
