<p class="intro">I have been in love with writing since childhood because I found out keeping track of work and life is very helpful with not wasting my time.  Inspired by <a href = "http://yihui.name/en">Yihui Xie</a> who is a well-known data scientist in the Chinese R/stats community, and my friend <a href = "http://linxihui.github.io/">Eric</a>, I finally decided to do it today! <p>

<h2>How do I create the website </h2>
The website is created with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a simple, blog-aware, static site generator, and <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> where I can manage codes easily. The reason why I use them is that you can have full control over everything: your posts, layouts, figures, syntax highlighting of codes, even LaTex-like mathematical formulas! Literally everything. Check out the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll Docs</a> for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. The articles are written with <a href="https://stackedit.io/">StackEdit</a>[StackEdit]so that I only need to focus on writing instead of annoying format stuff. 

<h2> What you will find in my website </h2>
<ul>
<li>I will post my previous/ongoing projects in this website, mostly during my studies in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the <a href = "https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/"> University of Waterloo</a> and some internships.</li>
<li>What I have learned in statistical computing, interesting mathematical theory, machine learning, bid data, statistical modelling, mathematical finance, etc.  (Yup, I do have a wide range of interests.)</li>
<li>In an addition to technical stuff, I will also post photos that I took, my favourite Chinese poems, thoughts about life, jokes, introducing a bunch of guys who have great influence on me. Just to tell you that I'm a real HUMAN BEING not a robot :) Most posts falling into this category will be written in Chinese.</li>
