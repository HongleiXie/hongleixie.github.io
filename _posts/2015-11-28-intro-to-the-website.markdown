<p class="intro">I have been in love with writing since childhood because I found out keeping track of work and life is very helpful with not wasting my time.  Inspired by [Yihui Xie] who is a well-known data scientist in the Chinese R/stats community, and my friend [Eric], I finally decided to do it today! <p>

<h2>How do I create the website </h2>
The website is created with [Jekyll][jekyll], a simple, blog-aware, static site generator, and [Github page][githubpage] where I can manage codes easily. The reason why I use them is that you can have full control over everything: your posts, layouts, figures, syntax highlighting of codes, even LaTex-like mathematical formulas! Literally everything. Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. The articles are written with [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) so that I only need to focus on writing instead of annoying format stuff. 
<h2> What you will find in my website </h2>
<ul>
<li>I will post my previous/ongoing projects in this website, mostly during my studies in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the [University of Waterloo] and some internships.</li>
<li>What I have learned in statistical computing, interesting mathematical theory, machine learning, bid data, statistical modelling, mathematical finance, etc.  (Yup, I do have a wide range of interests.) For example, I'm currently auditing a course called *Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python* in [edX]. I may summarize course notes, time-by-time thoughts about this course, and my solutions to assignment problems here if I find them interesting.</li>
<li>In an addition to technical stuff, I will also post photos that I took, my favourite Chinese poems, thoughts about life, jokes, introducing a bunch of guys who have great influence on me. Just to tell you that I'm a real HUMAN BEING not a robot :) Most posts falling into this category will be written in Chinese.</li>
