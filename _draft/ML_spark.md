title:  "Machine Learning Pipeline with Spark"

<span class="dropcap">T</span>his is a lab originally from edX [course: Big Data Analysis with Apache Spark](https://www.edx.org/course/big-data-analysis-apache-spark-uc-berkeleyx-cs110x#!).
which I found would be a good starting point to get to know machine learning pipeline with Spark.
Same as the original notebook, I will show an end-to-end example of performing Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset,
and then applying simple Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms to solve a supervised regression problem on the dataset.
