<span class="dropcap">R</span> is awesome, probably the *best* tool for statisticians. 
If someone in the data analytics area doesn't like it, I guess the effiency and its way of memory allocation might be primary reasons. 

I assume this post will be edited time-by-time.

For the time being, my strateges to speed up R can be summarized as follows:

- More powerful computer? Not exactly, doesn't make much difference.... but you may want a faster server of course!
- Use fast importing data package.
- Try to specify as many options as you can.
- Vectorize your code.
- Parallel computing.
- Try to avoid `for` loop as possible as you can.
- Pre-allocate data structures always.
- Use `Rcpp` package. 
- Remove useless variables and data and flush memory as early as possible.
